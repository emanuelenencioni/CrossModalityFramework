- [X] Finish yaml loading
- [X] finish train_from_config
- [X] wandb integration

- [ ] Add frame as voxel_grid alternative. (maybe a model that can use both? or any event representation? can it be adaptable?)

- [ ] look at detr for fusion or similar approaches.
- [ ] Try two different backbones architectures.
